# Global-Financial-Access
Create a website such as eBay only based on cryptocurrencies 
Hello world - I am new to coding, so I dot't understand much about it. Though I do not think this configure a huge impediment to what we
can do. So, first things first: The purpose of this project is to create a website to reinforce and sustain the ability to cryptocurrencies
have to proportionate to the world where everyone has access to anything (legal in each country, of course). Also it will empower the
cryptocurrencies, sustaining its permanence futerwise.
I am from Brazil, and here, buying cryptocurrencies is very expensive - you spend a lot of money on these exchangers,
and to convert your cryptocurrencies to dollars or reais (official currency of Brazil) you have to spend a lot of money on taxes again,
fot these means people are using cryptocurrencies as a way of saving money, and they do not spend it at all.
My goal with this website is to create a platform where anyone can buy and sell anything just like eBay, but only cryptocurrencies are
available, so we actually will use this as currency.
Ok, you will tell me that there are a lot of ways to use it, but seriosly, how many times have you used your bitcoins, moneros, ethereums
to buy something other than dollars (or your local currency)?
